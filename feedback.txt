Hi Maaz,

Thanks for your submission. Here are some comments:

1. Very nice implementation. You have completed all baseline and bonus requirements.
2. Minor problems found by code inspection on intellij. You can analyse them to make code even cleaner.
3. As instructed in the description, use .gitignore to exlude files that should not be pushed into the repo, ex. .idea.

Grade: 10%
